# Air hockey Game
Created for C291 final project where I implemented the game Air Hockey using C.

#### Air Hockey has the following components
   * Ball
   * Zone
   * Two sliders
#### Game Features
   * Ball changes direction after colliding with the slider or boundaries of the zone
   * Player who controls the bottom slider wins the game if ball touches the top boundary of the zone and vice-versa.
#### The following are the controls of the game
   * Left Arrow Key - Moves the bottom slider to left.
   * Right Arrow Key - Moves the bottom slider to right.
   * A - Moves the top slider to left.
   * D - Moves the top slider to right.
